            <h2>About </h2>
            <p>
            With more than 850 restaurants nationwide, we recognize our unique position to help provide hunger relief in the local communities we serve. In 2003, we created our Harvest program, where
            all restaurants gather wholesome, surplus food every day and carefully prepare for a weekly donatio to a local non-profit organization. Olive Garden restaurants have donated over 40 million pounds of food, and we also partner with Feeding AmericaÂ® to help children and 
            families facing hunger in our communities.
